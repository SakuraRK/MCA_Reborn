Minecraft Comes Alive Reborn
=====================

Minecraft Comes Alive (MCA) 是一个船新的Minecraft模组，它让村民更加智能、也更加有生命力！它可以用于本地局域网、单人游戏以及SMP服务器。

Villagers can be interacted with - you can talk to them, ask them to follow you, set their home, give them gifts, etc. Interacting with people builds relationships. Get your relationship high enough, and you will be able to marry someone.

After getting married, you will be able to have children who will do many chores for you such as: Farming, Fishing, Woodcutting, Hunting, and Mining.

Children will eventually grow up into adults. Adults can get married and have children of their own, and this cycle can repeat indefinitely!

MCA Reborn is a rewrite of MCA for Minecraft 1.16.5 and upwards, featuring extended village management, villager genetics and various enhancements.

## CurseForge
